**This paper has been accepted to IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics (IEEE TII).**

Paper: [IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9720080)

This offical implementation of PKD (Pseudo Knowledge Distillation) from On-device Saliency Prediction based on Pseudo Knowledge Distillation by [Chakkrit Termritthikun](https://chakkritte.github.io/cv/).

**This code is based on the implementation of  [EML-NET-Saliency](https://github.com/SenJia/EML-NET-Saliency), [SimpleNet](https://github.com/samyak0210/saliency), [MSI-Net](https://github.com/alexanderkroner/saliency), and [EEEA-Net](https://github.com/chakkritte/EEEA-Net).**

## Prerequisite for server
 - Tested on Ubuntu OS version 18.04.x
 - Tested on PyTorch 1.6 and TorchVision 0.7.0
